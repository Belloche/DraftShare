# Time Log

| Date | Task | Hours | Notes |
|------|------|-------|------|
| 2-9-21 | Created Site Outline | 2 | Based off project pitch and my own outline |
| 2-19-21 | Chose colors for site and created index.jsp with hardcoded template for reference | 3 | Got sick, so I didn't get nearly as much done as I wanted, but I have what the site should hopefully look like |
| 2-26-21 | Created viewDraft.jsp based off the template (still using template for visual), got sick AGAIN which is not what I like, but I hit my flow now |
| 3-2-21 | Created the database for DraftShare, including a users table and a table for the drafts (which has 96 rows just for the picks) | 3 |
| 3-9-21 | Deployed to AWS with a page displaying data from the database | 7 | Right now I just have one entry and all that is being displayed is the thumbnail, but it will work no problem on the full draft view soon. |
| 3-23-21 | Added user authentication for view draft | 3 | Right now there is one user and only view draft works for the system currently |
| 4-1-21 | Added GenericDao | 2 | I added a GenericDao so I don't have to have as much duped code |
| 4-7-21 | Fixed test package | 4 | I had to fix the test package Database file, everything passes just fine now |
| 4-11-21 | ViewDraft outputs data | 3 | A little more to do so the draft picks are displayed through a loop but ViewDraft does display real data now |
