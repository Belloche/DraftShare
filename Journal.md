Week 1
1/23/2021

Chose my project goal
Wrote problem statement

I have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to do for the project, I think the harder parts
of what I want to do might get a little hairy like with a possible upvote system.
I also want to let users change the draft order so I'm narrowing down how I'll
accomplish that.


Week 2
2/1/2021

Created my repository

After some trouble getting my project created properly I finally have it pushed to git.

Week 4
2/9/2021

I finished up what I want the project to do without overextending and started choosing a color scheme

Week 5
2/19/2021

Got sick and only got index.jsp completed, but the visual is just about what I want. Visual right now is only a reference template but gets across what it will look like

Week 6
2/26/2021

Got sick again which is unfortunate, got viewDraft.jsp in with another template. I think I can do this pretty well now.

Week 7
3/2/2021

I created the database for the project, now for the DAO. Will update this entry when it is completed.

Week 8
3/9/2021

I missed this entry when I was working, but I have deployed the project to AWS. I also fleshed out the home page a bit and the thumbnail on the site is data from the database on AWS. The Full Draft page is still hardcoded but I will be getting to that. Next week when I get back from my vacation I will be implementing a login for Checkpoint 3.

Week 9
3/23/2021

Last week was Spring Break, and now that I'm back I'm adding login capability to DraftShare and the login page.
