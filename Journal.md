Chose my project goal
Wrote problem statement

I have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to do for the project, I think the harder parts
of what I want to do might get a little hairy like with a possible upvote system.
I also want to let users change the draft order so I'm narrowing down how I'll
accomplish that.


Week 2

Created my repository

After some trouble getting my project created properly I finally have it pushed to git.
