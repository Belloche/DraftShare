# Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
1-18-21 - 3 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Chose my project
* Created repository
* Formulated problem statement

I came up with my project and started coming up with the minimum viable product so I don't overextend or underperform.

### Week 4
2-9-21

Tasks Completed:
* Put all information in md files in repository
* Created User Stories
* Created Site Design

The last few weeks have been more stressful than I realized, and I fell behind in my classes.
This week I caught up and now I'm getting the site design completed.

### Weeks 5-8
3-12-21

Tasks Completed:
* Created Database
* Created home page with data displayed
* Deployed to AWS

I updated my time log and journal, but not the weekly reflections, that's on me. I've been having issues in my body. I've been breaking down, getting a weekly migraine, and that's on top of my usual procrastination.
I did however get caught up on work this week, and I plan on doing extra work over spring break for checkpoint 3.

### Week 9
3-23-21

Tasks Completed:
* Created a better database for users and roles
* Added user authentication

As I'm writing this I haven't pushed it to AWS yet, but as soon as I get this pushed to Git I will create the necessary tables in AWS and get it working.

### Week 10
4-1-21

Tasks Completed:
* Implemented a GenericDao

I implemented a GenericDao so my Draft and User entities don't have to use duped code in separate files.

### Week 11
4-5-21

Tasks Completed:
* Removed Login/Sign Up from nav to rework

I've hit a snag where I can't start my project since the @BeforeEach won't call in my tests, but I'm reworking how my users log in so you can create an account from the login form that pops up automatically when you click on restricted content.

4-11-21

Tasks Completed:
* Updated ViewDraft to display data from the DB

The ViewDraft page displays real data now, but I need to rework the page to use a loop for each pick so it works better and the file is a lot smaller.
