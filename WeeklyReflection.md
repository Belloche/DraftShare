# Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
1-18-21 - 3 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Chose my project
* Created repository
* Formulated problem statement

I came up with my project and started coming up with the minimum viable product so I don't overextend or underperform.

### Week 4
2-9-21

Tasks Completed:
* Put all information in md files in repository
* Created User Stories
* Created Site Design

The last few weeks have been more stressful than I realized, and I fell behind in my classes.
This week I caught up and now I'm getting the site design completed.
