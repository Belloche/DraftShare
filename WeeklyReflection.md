# Weekly Reflections

### Week 1
1-18-21 - 3 hours

Tasks Completed:
* Chose my project
* Created repository
* Formulated problem statement

I came up with my project and started coming up with the minimum viable product so I don't overextend or underperform.

### Week 4
2-9-21

Tasks Completed:
* Put all information in md files in repository
* Created User Stories
* Created Site Design

The last few weeks have been more stressful than I realized, and I fell behind in my classes.
This week I caught up and now I'm getting the site design completed.

### Weeks 5-8
3-12-21

Tasks Completed:
* Created Database
* Created home page with data displayed
* Deployed to AWS

I updated my time log and journal, but not the weekly reflections, that's on me. I've been having issues in my body. I've been breaking down, getting a weekly migraine, and that's on top of my usual procrastination.
I did however get caught up on work this week, and I plan on doing extra work over spring break for checkpoint 3.

### Week 9
3-23-21

Tasks Completed:
* Created a better database for users and roles
* Added user authentication

As I'm writing this I haven't pushed it to AWS yet, but as soon as I get this pushed to Git I will create the necessary tables in AWS and get it working.

### Week 10
4-1-21

Tasks Completed:
* Implemented a GenericDao

I implemented a GenericDao so my Draft and User entities don't have to use duped code in separate files.

### Week 11
4-5-21

Tasks Completed:
* Removed Login/Sign Up from nav to rework

I've hit a snag where I can't start my project since the @BeforeEach won't call in my tests, but I'm reworking how my users log in so you can create an account from the login form that pops up automatically when you click on restricted content.

4-11-21

Tasks Completed:
* Updated ViewDraft to display data from the DB

The ViewDraft page displays real data now, but I need to rework the page to use a loop for each pick so it works better and the file is a lot smaller.

### Week 12-13
4-25-21

Tasks Completed:
* Updated CreateDraft to be responsive
* Added Bootstrap
* CreateDraft is Complete (nearly)
* Login looks better
* Signup created but erroring

I missed an entry last week but still got plenty done. I added bootstrap for responsive styling, createDraft is working nicely, and I added user registry, though you can't get access to the pages yet since the roles need to be added as well.

### Week 14
5-2-21

Tasks Completed:
* Updated CSS so the colors don't hurt your eyes
* Found an API from Hipo for a list of colleges to add to the college dropdown on createDraft
* Signup works now
* UserPage works properly
* Working on a logout button

I'm starting implementation on Lombok finally, it should shrink file size a considerable amount since some of my Entities are thousands of lines long. I also need to add upvote and downvote, which shouldn't take long, a password change, and a search, which should also be easy enough to implement. Anxiety ensues with the final week of work that I have.

### Week 15

Tasks Completed:
* All features working
* Search all drafts working
* Updated HTML and CSS for accessibility (WIP)
* Fixed Draft Tests for 90% coverage
* Added Lombok

That was a rough week. My project is almost done, I need to finish tests, add documentation, and finish HTML and CSS to pass accessibility tests, but then I just need to make a presentation.

### Week 16

Tasks Completed:
* Finished Project
* Uploaded Presentation

I really hope I can at least get a 45% on it, I like my project and I'd feel so bad if it turns out I did a really bad job.
